I've been thinking a lot about Jeff Geerling's post ["Why I close PRs (OSS project maintainer notes)"](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2016/why-i-close-prs-oss-project-maintainer-notes) lately. If you do submit a PR and feel that I'm closing down the conversation, this is most likely the rationale behind it.
